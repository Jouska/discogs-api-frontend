### Tom Halliwell / Pirate Studios / Front end test

This application has been developed to interact with the Discogs API; allowing a user to search for an artist, view their releases and sort them.

This is a version that has been updated outside of the 2 hour test window, and now includes these feature:

Display of loaders in UI during API fetch

Full UI sort controls

Error handling for no search results
